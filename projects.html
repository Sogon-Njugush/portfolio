      <h3>RESEARCH PROJECT</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>TITLE: KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE OF BREAST SELF EXAMINATION AMONG FEMALE STUDENTS IN KABARAK UNIVERSITY</ul></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The practice of breast self-examination by female students at Kabarak University was the subject of this study. It was supported by research conducted by other academics that shows an increase in the frequency of young women developing breast cancer. This is concerning, hence the primary objective was to assess female students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices around BSE. The specific objectives guiding the study included determining the knowledge, assessing the attitudes,and establishing the practices of breastself-examination among female students at Kabarak University.
      A survey was thus conducted where 190 respondents were issued questionnaires out of which 175 successfully returned. About 50% of these participants had the belief that early screening and detection was the most suitable method to control breast cancer. The majority of the participants knew about BSE and a good number also practice it. They had learned about BSE through health professionals. The main reason for the failure of BSE screening included the absence of adequate knowledge of the procedure.
      It was concluded that there was a need to create awareness by sharing information on breast cancer, risk factors, and BSE. The study recommends programs to increase public awareness can help and training initiatives. Healthcare professionals should also advocate for BSE.
